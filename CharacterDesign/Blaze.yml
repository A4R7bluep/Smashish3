Appearance: |
    Blaze stands at an imposing height, his demonic form radiating intense heat and ethereal flames. 
    His body is lean and muscular, adorned with intricate black and crimson armor, reminiscent of molten lava. 
    Dark, smoldering horns curve back from his forehead, framing his fierce, glowing ember-like eyes.
    Streams of infernal fire dance and flicker around his body, trailing behind him as he moves with an otherworldly grace. 
    His clawed hands and feet crackle with searing energy, leaving scorch marks on the ground. 
    Blaze's deep, menacing voice resonates with the echoes of the underworld, striking fear into the hearts of his adversaries.
    From his back, twin colossal wings unfold, comprised of blazing feathers that emit a radiant glow. 
    As he readies himself for battle, the air around him shimmers with intense heat, and wisps of smoke and embers rise from his demonic form.
    Blaze's presence is an embodiment of the inferno itself, a relentless force of destruction that leaves a trail of ash and cinders in his wake.
