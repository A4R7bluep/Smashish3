        The blade is curved backward 
        The blade is bone white with a groove along the contour near the spine side, going from the guard to the tip

Lore:
    - Xeaus and his friends, Marc and Nils, died in the forest and were not found
    - He awoke as a vampire a couple days later after his body had rotted a while
    - He was hungry so he slipped into the village and killed and drank the blood of everyone
    - He gained power and his body regenerated to what he looks like now
    - Afterward, he looked at what he had done and was filled with anguish
    - He decided to only feed upon his enemies and animals (even though he hated the taste of animals)
    - Decided to fight only if necessary
    

Intro Quotes:
    Xeaus Stage:
        (bows) Marc Kraus and Nils KÃ¤ndler, may you rest in peace.
        (yells to the sky) Oh what a monster I have become! May I be useful to the world to make up for it!
    
    General:
        I wish not to kill you unless I have to.
        Let's get this over with.
    
    Enemy?:
        Your death shall be painful.
        I pity you. You could have been a good person.


Win Quotes:
    Enemy?:
        I shall give you a proper burial.
        (Xeaus stage) Your body shall fertilize the forest.
        Be happy in your new freedom and my you rest in peace.
    
    General:
        I am sorry for hurting you, I shall heal you now.
        I hope that was enough of a show of my power for you to stop fighting me. I don't want to use too much more because I might accidentally kill you.


Stage: 
    a forest with lush deciduous trees and a path going along the length
    infinite/looping?


Mechanics: 
    Possible - If a move is used in the last 10 moves multiple times, damage is reduced
    Blood meter - Drink dagger blood for attack boost

    Mechanic Overrides:
        Air dash - Like Zato's where it allows you to fly in the air, in bat form
        Shadow Step - Step dash instead of run, extra invincibility, appears to hide into the shadows out of nowhere
