Name: Infernal Abyss
Stage Description:
    The Infernal Abyss is a treacherous battleground set deep within the fiery depths of hell.
    It is a nightmarish landscape of eternal torment and unforgiving chaos.
    The stage is surrounded by towering obsidian cliffs, spewing molten lava that cascades down their jagged edges.
    The air is thick with sulfurous fumes and the acrid scent of brimstone.
    In the center of the stage lies a massive circular platform, suspended above a lake of bubbling lava.
    The platform is adorned with demonic symbols etched into its surface, pulsating with an ominous glow.
    Fiery geysers periodically erupt from the molten depths below, sending scorching waves of heat across the battlefield.
    Gnarled and withered trees, twisted by the relentless flames, dot the outskirts of the stage.
    They stand as eerie sentinels, their branches devoid of leaves, emitting an eerie red glow.
    Occasional bursts of embers and sparks rise from the charred ground, casting an eerie and flickering illumination upon the hellish scenery.
    From time to time, ominous demonic figures, trapped in eternal torment, emerge from the shadows, watching the battle unfold with malicious delight.
    Their wails and moans echo through the infernal domain, adding to the haunting atmosphere.
    As the fight rages on, the backdrop morphs, revealing glimpses of other infernal realms.
    Phantasmal creatures and serpentine demons slither through the fiery cracks, momentarily glimpsed between the chaos.
    The ground occasionally shifts, creating perilous platforms or chasms that threaten to consume any unfortunate combatants who misstep.
