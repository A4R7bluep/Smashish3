Corrupted Character
The name in game would flicker between random letters that slowly form the name ENTITY

The character is posessed by a demon that, over the time of the game, gains more control over it's host
Smoke is flowing around the host, more smoke the higher level of corruption
When the character gets hit, the corruption goes down
Higher corruption levels allow for more powerful moves and strengthens the weaker moves
The character has high pressure from using up some of the corruption to cancel attack lag; basically GGST Roman Cancels

After a certain amount of time, the character slowly looses health, making it a game of getting corruption meter and then trying to finish the game quickly
