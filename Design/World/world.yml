        Tree of life:
            - Luminary at the top
            - Branches off into the 3 angels, Terra, Iklith, and Eum
            - Terra made Earth
            - Iklith made hell
            - Eum made the cosmos

        The Luminary (God):
            - Can see all time
            - Making himself pure as giving the angels parts of himself

        Creation:
            In the beginning, there was only The Luminary. He was an all knowing, all seeing being. He knew what was to happen from the beginning of time, to the end.
            He looked into the future and saw an endless beauty. He saw what he needed to do to achieve it and began by creating 3 angels,
            Terra, Iklith, and Eum. He pulled out parts of himself to make the angels. He made Terra from his kindness, excitement to do work, and greed.
            He made Iklith from his evil side, and Eum his good side, adding a love for mysteriousness for spice.
            One day, Terra asked the Luminary for the power to give life. That life needed a vessel to live on so he asked her if she'd sacrifice herself for that power.
            She said yes, so he sacrificed her and she became the Earth. As he promised, life sprouted from the from the soil and the oceans.
            He also gave Iklith and Eum the power to make creation.
            Iklith and Eum were constantly fighting, so Iklith decided to make a separate world to make her creations of evil and to hide from Eum.
            Eum, knowing that Iklith would eventually come to attack her, took some of the humans on Earth and changed them, forming elves.
            Eum taught the elves how to use magic, the ability to borrow some energy from Eum to do work.
            She made the elves interested in saving the Earth, as she had loved her sister Terra, but also knowing that they would save her from Iklith.
            Iklith, in her world called hell, started making her own creatures.
            She created demons, devils, and imps and said that the strongest of them would be the lord of hell.
            She wanted her minions to have some motivation to become strong enough to fight Eum. She gave her creations a hatred for all that Eum and Terra had made.

            Story:
                One silent night, some raiders came and attacked a small village. In their greed, they stole anything valuable and burnt homes.
                The elves, living in the forest nearby, seeing the smoke and flames, came over to see what was going on, but they were too late. 
                All that was left was smouldering timber. As they were about to go, sad that they couldn't have helped, they heard a young girl crying.
                One elf walked up to the human child and picked him up. Her parents must have hid him, or she was extremely lucky.
                The elves took her back to the forest, where they lived in the trees. Riuvyn, the elf that had originally picked her up, raised her as his own.
                When she grew older, he taught her magic and the way of fighting with a sword. She was made fun of by the other elf children.
                She grew up faster then they did and didn't have pointy ears. She often came running home to Riuvyn crying.
