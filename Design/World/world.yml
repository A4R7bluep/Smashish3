        The Luminary (God):
            - Can see all time
            - Making himself pure as giving the angels parts of himself

        Creation:
            In the beginning, there was only The Luminary. He was an all knowing, all seeing being. He knew what the beginning to the end of time looked like.
            He looked into the future and saw the endless beauty that existed there. He saw what he needed to do to achieve that and began by creating 3 angels,
            Terra, Iklith, and Eum. He pulled out parts of himself to make the angels. He made Terra from his kindness, excitement to do work, and greed.
            He made Iklith from his evil side, and Eum his good side, adding a love for mysteriousness for spice.
            One day, Terra asked the Luminary for the power to give life. That life needed a vessel to live on so he asked her if she'd sacrifice herself for that power.
            She said yes, so he sacrificed her and she became the Earth. As he promised, life sprouted from the from the soil and the oceans. 
            He also gave Iklith and Eum the power to make creation.
            Iklith and Eum were constantly fighting, so Iklith decided to make a separate world to make her creations of evil and to hide from Eum.
            Eum, knowing that Iklith would eventually come to attack her, took some of the humans on Earth and changed them, forming elves.
            She made the elves interested in saving the Earth, as she had loved her sister Terra, but also knowing that they would save her from Iklith.
            Eum also gave the elves magic, with which they could better fight for her against Iklith. Iklith, in her world called hell, started making her own creatures.
            She created demons, devils, and imps and said that the strongest of them would be the lord of hell.
            She wanted her minions to have some motivation to become strong enough to fight Eum. She gave her creations a hatred for all that Eum and Terra had made.
